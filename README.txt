V1.5.11

Main feature additions/improvements:

The Mixer panel now presents parts with separate left and right VU meters.

There is an overall mono/stereo button in the main window.

If any controls in an effect are different from the listed preset, the colour of the preset background is changed to a strong blue.

When an AddSynth voice or modulator is using the oscillator from a lower numbered one, on entering the waveform editor there is a warning in red at the top of the window.

In the microtonal section the 'A' note frequency range has been fixed as 329Hz to 660Hz.

All controls that operate only when others are in particular states are shown as inactive when not available.

There is a small information window that opens instantly, and only remains visible until the main window is displayed.

On a first time start there is a window overlaying the centre of the main one, prompting you to check settings via the Yoshimi drop-down menu.
