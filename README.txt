Version 2.3.0 - Painted Bunting

There's been a major overhaul of the graphics for better visibility.

We've added a very complete user-definable colour theme system.

There is indication when any rotary control or slider is not at its default.

Many controls are now high resolution yet both forward and backward compatible
with older Yoshimi versions.

All the documentation has been revised.
