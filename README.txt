V1.7.2

In brief:

In the voice editors you can now change the width and centre position of random panning.

Last seen banked instrument can now be highlighted.

There are three more options in LFO type.

In the 'doc' directory we've added a PDF with a brief list of all CCs and NRPNs that Yoshimi recognises.

All these are of course accessible to the command line.

More details are in /doc/Yoshimi_1.7.2_features.txt
