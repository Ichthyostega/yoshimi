V 1.5.10 Redwing

Unfortunately a bug has been found that seems to affect only official fedora builds. To ensure complete compatibility we now have V 1.5.10.1 as a bugfix release.

Command Line access is now virtually complete.

The graphic interface has had a minor makeover. Also, very occasional corruption of this is now resolved.

All inactive controls are now shown as such - there were a number that previously weren't, thus causing considerable confusion for new users.

There is an improved pseudo-random number system, which does not rely on external libraries anymore.

Further details can be found in /doc/Yoshimi_1.5.10_features.txt
