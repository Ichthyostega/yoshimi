For yoshimi versions 1.2.1 or later

BankProgChangeTest

Expects you to have the included banks as your default bank root dir, otherwise you would need to change the bank and program numbers. Also expects 'Bank Change' set to MSB and 'Enable On Load' to be checked.

Mastersynth High is chosen for the slow pads to really stress test the changes.

There are a couple of deliberately invalid changes.

Rosegarden version lets you see exactly where the changes take place.
