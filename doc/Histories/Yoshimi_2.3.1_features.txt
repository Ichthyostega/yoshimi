Version 2.3.1

There have been improvements in the handling of microtonal scales.
First off, you can now export scales and keymaps.

We were not handlng Scala imports that have comments attached to the numeric entries.
This has been fixed, and these are now saved in our XML files.

We've corrected the handling of zero size keymaps. This sets the same map series as if
there was no mapping, but the First, Middle, Last key entries are still active.

Unfortunately these changes are not backward compatible, but Yoshimi will still correctly
handle older files.

If the virtual keyboard is visible, selecting instruments from a bank will pass focus back
to it. This means you can quickly try out various instruments without any external kit attached.

Window title bars are now more consistent in both style and content. There had been a number of
them with poor descriptions and a few with none!

We've revised some of the MIDI example files so that they use bank root 5. This should always point to a copy of the default bank set.

As usual there are a few bugfixes including an extremely obscure crash in PadSynth which only
occurred with a somewhat contrived setup.
