V 1.5.2 - Goldfinch
Just because... LAC2017 :)

We now implement the fairly new LV2 state:StateChanged URI
This means any change you make in the Yoshimi GUI will be reported to the host.


MIDI-learn improvements:

The current learned list is now included in state saves.

NRPNs can now be set as 7bit (LSB only). This is used by some hardware synths and controllers.

Min and Max values are now shown as percentages and have a resolution of 0.5%

Much of the controllers window, and quite a lot of 'switches' (such as engine enables, kit item mutes) are now learnable and act silently. Most of these are 'next note'.

Learnable checkboxes have a pale blue surround (a similar colour to rotary controls).

Learnable Menus and Selectors have their arrows the same blue colour.

Note. To learn menus you need to make an actual selection with the right mouse button while holding down the Ctrl key.


Under the hood:

More Gui controls transferred to the new lock-free system.

The usual round of ancient and modern bugfixes.
