If Yoshimi has been started from the command line, all of the system setting that don't require a restart can now be viewed by sending the appropriate NRPN. Most of them can also be changed in this way.

Please also refer to command line.

To access this, set NRPN MSB (CC 99) to 64 and NRPN LSB (CC 98) to 2 [8130]

After that send the following DATA values.
