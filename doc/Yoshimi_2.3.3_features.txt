Version 2.3.3

There has been further work on GUI themes managment, along with unification and consolidation of some background colours. Added to this, there are improvements for those wanting to edit themes. Most notably, if you edit a theme currently being used, Yoshimi will automatically update the display as you make the changes. To avoid unnecessary processor use, this is only done while the themes window is open.

A new 'Monochrome' control has been added to themes that converts all window colours to grey scale values. This is to help theme creators ensure that the display will work well for colourblind users. It revealed that the default theme we've used for years behaves rather poorly, and work is under way to develop a high contrast alternative.

There has been a major effort updating all the underlying code structure in keeping with modern memory-safe practices. In the process a few rather obscure bugs have been identifed and squashed.

Configuration control has been improved - using start-up options no longer modifies the stored settings.

The range of keyboard shortcuts has been extended (for the current window with focus).

Some long-standing display issues have been resolved, in particular relating to graphs.

We have new instruments added to the banks and the usual doccumentation updates.
