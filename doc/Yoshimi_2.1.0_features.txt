V 2.1.0 - A Marsh Warbler (that can change it's warble speed)

In this release (in the 'doc' directory) the new HTML user guide is the default, and it is also the one fetched from the Yoshimi drop-down menu.

It now includes an appendix.
This has the common Note names, their MIDI note numbers, and actual frequencies.
It also has a complete list of the specific CCs and NRPNS that Yoshimi recognises.

Midi Sync has now been applied to all the effects where it is relevant - such as the Echo delay time.

NRPNs have been extended so that you can now set the System Effect sends. Related to that, you can also set the Part to System Effect sends.

We've changed some of the CLI command names slightly so they are better identified, and a few can have shorter abbreviations.

It is now possible for developers to make precise, repeatable tests of actual sound produced, so that in future we can ensure that no unintended changes are made.

The new file manager has been made more consistent and the performance improved.

There are also a few more small general improvements, along with bugfixes.

As usual, we welcome all suggestions and assistance - especially regarding documentation!
