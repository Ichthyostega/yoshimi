V 2.0.1

This has no new features. It's another maintenance release with a smattering of small improvements, along with bugfixes.

In the GUI, analog filters that are set to Low1 or High1 now have the Q dial deactivated. Single pole filters don't have Q, and this control seeming to not work was confusing some users.

There are a few new instrument patches.
Stick Hit in Drums.
Scaffold Pole, Sharp Sweep Synth, Sharp Sweep Multi, Surf in Companion.
