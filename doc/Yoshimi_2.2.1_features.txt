Version 2.2.1

There is a useful addition of a reset button in the part edit window. This sets the instrument to the default in the same way as the instrument instrument drop menu down does, but is more convenient.

Also for both of these methods, if you hold down the ctrl key it will then offer to clear the entire part instead, i.e. controllers, aftertouch etc. The confirmation message has also been updated so that you know exactly which of these actions is about to be performed.

There are more windows that now stay open when you change parts and update in place. These are the part Edit window itself, Kit, Effects, Controllers, MIDI CCs, Aftertouch. All of these will also reopen if they were visible when Yoshimi was last closed.

If the main window has focus, the Escape key action has been disabled. This is so you don't accidentally drop right out of Yoshimi.

Two new instruments have been added to the banks, 'Ride' in Drums and 'Nostagia' in Synth.

The user guide and various docs have been updated.

There are also a number of code improvements and a few bug fixes.
