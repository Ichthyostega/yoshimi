Out_There.mid & Out_There.xmz

This MIDI file and Yoshimi patch set will play a 5 minute complex 12 part tune.

Load the patchset into Yoshimi then, in a terminal window enter:

aplaymidi -p yoshimi /usr/local/share/doc/yoshimi/examples/Out_There.mid

Depending how Yoshimi was installed, 'examples' may be at a different location.
