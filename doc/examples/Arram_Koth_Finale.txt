Arram_Koth_Finale.mid

This MIDI file will completely set up a running version of Yoshimi, and play the last part of the Arram Koth theme. It will set banks and load instruments as needed.

If the Reports window is visible this will show what control actions are taking place.

The only requirement is that bank root number 5 points to the default set of banks, as this is the one that will be selected.

aplaymidi -p yoshimi /usr/local/share/doc/yoshimi/examples/Arram_Koth_Finale.mid

Depending how Yoshimi was installed, 'examples' may be at a different location.
