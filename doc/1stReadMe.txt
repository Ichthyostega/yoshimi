These files are currently just random info that will eventually be turned into proper documentation.

Any additional notes are more than welcome. If you like, you can send them to me at:

For the sake of completeness in the Historiesdirectory there is some info on ZynAddSubFx from its beginning up to the time of the Yoshimi fork. Other information will be placed there from time to time.
