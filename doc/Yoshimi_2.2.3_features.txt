Version 2.2.3

The Command Line can now use Yoshimi's Copy/Paste feature and stored presets. Currently this only partially updates the GUI, and can sometimes produce spurious 'Not Available' messages. This is work in progress and while it won't be an issue for those with sight issues, we will be developing it further.

When editing vowels in the (GUI) formant filter, there is now a reddish background to the vowel field if none of the sequence positions call for it. The fact that you can be editing a vowel that isn't actually in use, can be quite confusing otherwise!
This is also reflected in the command line where there is a '?' after the vowel number, if it's not in use.

Both the Formant and EQ effect windows now use 'human friendy' numbering, rather than counting from zero. This is also reflected in the Command line.

The command line also now has a specific context for the formant editor, making it more obvious where you are and simplifying some of the commands.

The HTML User Guide and various docs have been updated.

There are also more code improvements and a some bug fixes.
