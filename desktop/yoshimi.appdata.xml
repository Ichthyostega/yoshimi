 <summary>A Software Synthesizer for Linux</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
  Yoshimi is a MIDI software synthesizer for Linux. It synthesizes in real time, can run polyphonic and/or 
  monophonic in multiple simultaneous patches in one or more MIDI channels, has extensive microtonal 
  capability, and much more. It includes extensive addititive, subtractive, and PAD synth capabilities 
  which can be run simultaneously within the same patch. And it has extensive effects capabilities as well.
  </p>
  <p>
  Originally based on the 2.4.0 version of ZynAddSubFX (Copyright 2002-2009 Nasca Octavian Paul), 
  development of Yoshimi has continued for quite a while now in its own directions. These include 
  extensive optimizations for audio and MIDI performance, and more recently progressive extension 
  of user-level access to all controls. At the same time refinement continues, both visually and 
  within the code.

  <p>
  Since the project's beginning, many amazing patches have since been written explicitly for 
  Yoshimi, quite a few of which are now included. Come on in and join the fun!
