Installing yoshimi

It's a CMake build. Simply cd to the src directory, then
    ccmake .
    cmake .
    make
    sudo make install
which builds an executable called yoshimi, installed by default in
/usr/local/bin.

Unlike ZynAddSubFX, Yoshimi builds with both Jack and Alsa audio and midi
options. The default audio and midi options to be used are nominated in the
ccmake configuration stage. Other options can be nominated at runtime via
command line parameters.

Yoshimi now installs its own copy of the instrument banks (installed by default
in usr/local/share/yoshimi/banks/). On startup, it also looks to the standard
zynaddsubfx bank directories, and deals politely with any duplications that may
exist there. You can tune your choice of bank directories via Settings.

If you get stuck, ask for help on LAU or
