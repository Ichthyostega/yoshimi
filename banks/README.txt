At 0.054.x Yoshimi installs the instrument files uncompressed, in order to
accommodate a weird little gzip error affecting only a few installations. This
results in about 7.2Mb extra disk space used - I can live with that.

At 0.053.x, Yoshimi installs it's own copy of the stock instrument banks
(instead of depending on a co-resident ZynAddSubFX installation).

Sources for the instruments presented are 
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/zynaddsubfx/>

and Will J Godfrey's outstanding Collection from Bits'n'Stuff on
