Installing yoshimi

It's a CMake build. Simply cd to the src directory, then
    ccmake .
    cmake .
    make
    sudo make install
which builds an executable called yoshimi, installed by default in
/usr/local/bin.

Unlike ZynAddSubFX, Yoshimi builds with both Jack and Alsa audio and midi
options. The default audio and midi options to be used are nominated in the
ccmake configuration stage. Other options can be nominated at runtime via
command line parameters.
