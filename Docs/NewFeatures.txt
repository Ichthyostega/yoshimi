When using the jack audio backend, parts can be individually routed and/or sent to the main L/R outputs. This is controlled from the panel window, and the settings are saved with all the other parameters.

Direct part outputs carry the part and insertion effects, but not system ones.

###

As well as bank and program changes there is the ability to set a MIDI CC to access the voices from 129 to 160. All the Bank controls are contained in a tab in the 'settings' window and take immediate effect.

###

Bank and program changes can be completely disabled in 'settings' - some hardware synths don't play nice!

###

There is now the possibility to add a 'naturalising' random pitch element to a part. This is found in the part edit window. The settings are not currently saved, but will be once the control values are settled, and there has been enough experience to decide whether it should be a part or voice setting.

###

From the command line, as well as autoconnecting the main L & R outputs to jack, with either jack or alsa midi you can now auto connect to a known source.

e.g.

 ./yoshimi -K --alsa-midi="Virtual Keyboard"
 ./yoshimi -K --jack-midi="jack-keyboard:midi_out"
 
Alsa can often manage with just the client name, but jack needs the port as well. These commands are case sensitive, and quite fussy about spaces etc. so it's wise to use quotes for the source name, even if they don't seem to be needed.

###

Yoshimi can now run as an LV2 plugin

Supported features:
1. Sample-accurate midi timing.
2. State save/restore support via LV2_State_Interface.
3. Working UI support via LV2_External_UI_Widget.
4. Programs interface support via LV2_Programs_Interface.
5. Multi channel audio output. 'outl' and 'outr' have lv2 index 2 and 3. All individual ports numbers start at 4.

Planned features:

2. Controls automation support. This will be a part of a common controls interface.

###

Bank root dirs are better identified, with IDs that can be changed by the user in the GUI. This is also made available for selecting over MIDI.

MIDI only sees banks in the *current* root dir, but all banks are accessible to the GUI.
