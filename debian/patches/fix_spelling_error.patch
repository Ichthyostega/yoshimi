-    Yoshimi is a highly complex synth with very extensive control options. Therefore, it is split up into a number of context sensitive windows to make this manageable. All of these windows are resizeable, and the size and position are stored. With the exception of the Console window, they also maintain their geometry and the contents are scaled accordingly.
