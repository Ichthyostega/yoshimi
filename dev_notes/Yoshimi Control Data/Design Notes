General design has been tested on Palemoon, Vivaldi, Brave and Firefox browsers.

Layout of table cells is designed to be easy to follow while allowing maximum space for descriptions.

Titles of data fields have exactly the same case as the actual commands.

Currently 'type' and 'source' fields are not presented. In the previous version these had either not been filled in at all or only for a few commands - may be reviewed.

General design and layout is set in a single css file - 'style.css'

Pages are fixed width to keep the layout structure consistent and easy to maintain.

A fixed location footer duplicate of table headers is only used for tables long enough to need scrolling - it would look odd with short tables!

To divide sections in long tables an 'empty' table row is used. In some cases this is followed by a table row with a single full width cell acting as a heading.

When editing files, table cells are arranged vertically rather than as the line they represent. They're much easier to edit that way!

Mostly in the descriptions, line breaks <br> are used to avoid confusing natural wrap-rounds.

'~ ~' is used to denote undefined values.
For numbers in a range use 'nn1~nn2'. This is more compact than using 'nn1 to nn2' For a specific group of numbers use 'nn1,nn2 etc'

Other examples:
0~2,8+(0~7)

0~63,241,242

    0,1
