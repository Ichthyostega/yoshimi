BUG! If jack is selected for audio but there are no physical ports Yoshimi quits with CLI warning - should run with gui warning as well, or better still loop back to try alsa.

Minor bug Multi instances produce jack error reports when main instance closed, even if they have been closed first - been there since V 1.4.1 :(

GUI Oddity. Pres spacebar on startup and you get directed to reset. Press it after tabbing down checkboxes and you enter the MIDI learn dialogue.

Investigate AddSynth amplitude modulation. Basic code is commented out in ring modulation.

Revise GUI voice list related to voice editor.

Effect change warning for dynfilter insert not yet done.

CLI waveform (in voice) changes don't update GUI unless waveform window is open too.

Requested: auto 'apply' timer for padsynth.

Expand MIDI-learn to include:
    learn groups (paging)
    GUI view by group but CLI and running search only by CC & chan

LV2: internal sound banks do not appear to be exposed as LV2 presets
Visible in carla apparently.

Consider enabling and disabling tooltips.

RPNs (channel based)

101,0 (MSB)

100,0 Pitch bend range
100,1 Fine detune
100,2 Coarse detune

Improve Copy & Paste functionality.

SYSEX - do we need it? If so, for what and how?
