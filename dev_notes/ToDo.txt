Send global and part keyshifts through ring buffer (like global fine detune).

Sort out direct access dynfilter->filter (and two enclosed controls). All work but don't update gui.

LV2: internal sound banks do not appear to be exposed as LV2 presets

CLI doesn't manage global detune, but direct access does.

Find out why LV2 only stores/retrieves patch sets (not state)

Make add voice & add/pad oscillator windows show kit number & name.

Consider, Pitchwheel split range in Controllers, but that one seems
a bit pointless to me!

Change root/bank/instrument lists to single file for all instances.

Make loading effect presets update the 'top' line.

Startup state load doesn't set buffersize correctly - partially resolved.
    size is ignored if loaded when already running (which is reasonable).

Allow headless compilation.

Add scales control to CLI.

Make things like LFOs either floats or much higher resolution.

Make LFOs active on sounding notes. Not easy!

Consider enabling and disabling tooltips.

Make attempt to start second independent instance open a new one in running
yoshimi instead - saves memory and more consistent.


RPNs (channel based)

101,0 (MSB)

100,0 Pitch bend range
100,1 Fine detune
100,2 Coarse detune

Maybe a NRPN variation of this for global fine tuning.

Improve Copy & Paste functionality.
