Fl::check() used too liberally. See where it can be removed - controls updating multiple windows seem the be the main problem.

Direct access to envelope not updating Gui graph, but seems to work otherwise.

Sort out direct access dynfilter->filter - controls work but don't update gui.

Expand midi-learn to include:
    more switches
    learn groups
    view by group but running search only by CC & chan
    move lines between groups

Make NRPN midi learn able to be re-learned.

LV2: internal sound banks do not appear to be exposed as LV2 presets

Make add voice & add/pad oscillator windows show kit number & name.

Make vector window update when main window reduces number of available parts.

Make loading effect presets update the 'top' line.

Allow headless compilation.

Add scales control to CLI.

Make things like Echo delay either floats or much higher resolution.

Consider enabling and disabling tooltips.

Make attempt to start second independent instance open a new one in running yoshimi instead - saves memory and more consistent.
