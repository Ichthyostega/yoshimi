This is not intended to be used within the realtime threads as both push and pop use mutex. However, they are very fast so you'd probably get away with it :)

There are just two calls:

int miscMsgPush( string )

string miscMsgPop( int )

These calls are accessible to all parts of Yoshimi and provide a simple asynchonous means of passing text between threads and functions via just the integer ID.

Pushing a message will return the first available ID and Popping a message makes its ID available again.

There is a maximum of 255 possible entries at any one time, but it's unlikely that limit will ever be reached.
