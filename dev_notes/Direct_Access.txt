This is an experimental test feature only accessible from the command line.

Currently It doesn't update the GUI, and there is minimal error checking.

Refer to "Yoshimi Control Numbers.ods" for control numbers and actions
and "GUI_Interpretations.txt" for further explanations.

Also, see "Effect_Inserts" for the actual effect controllers.

Sections currently in place and tested:

Top level controls
Main part controls
Controllers
Kit edit window
Subsynth Editor
Effects
Filters

The remaining ones will display as if they had been written to, but won't
actually change anything.

This matches the results from using the middle mouse button in the GUI. commands
that are purely within the GUI,e.g window changes are not implemented at all.
Some such as part number changes are (currently) recognised but not acted on.
It is expected that any alternative input system will store its own copies of
such intermediate information so that they remain fully independent.

An alternative way to find out the correct command sequence is to click on a
control with any button *except* the middle one. Trailing '255's can be ommitted
if there are no following parameters set.


The format is:

direct {value} {type} {control} {part} {kit} {engine} {insert} {parameter}

direct = the actual command name, must be typed in full.

value = the value that will be set, may be negative.

type = a subset of the command type: 0 for read and 64 for write.

control = the number representing the control being changed.

part = the number of the part being changed.

All the above are mandatory. The following must also be entered in sequence
when needed.

kit = a part's kit number (if enabled otherwise zero).
      also used for effects.

engine = the synth engine being adjusted.

insert = harmonics, LFOs, filters etc.

parameter = subtype associated with some inserts.
