This structure is intended to enable you to traverse the controls structure testing/adjusting at each level on the tree.

The function will be called directly and return a float value.

'type' will be used to determine the operation.

values (& 3)
0   return adjusted input to max and min.
1   return min
2   return default
3   return max

flags
bit 2   undefined
bit 3   from midi
bit 4   from cli
bit 5   from gui
bit 6   undefined
bit 7   regard as integer

Normal byte structure will be used to determine how far down the tree to go for a value.

e.g.
      value  type  command  part
limit  200     0      0     240

This would return 127 - the input value adusted to the maximium for master volume.


limit  any     3     255     0

No command set so it returns 64 - the maximim number of ordinary parts.
