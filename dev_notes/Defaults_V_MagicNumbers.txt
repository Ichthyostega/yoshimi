A new system for defining and accessing default values is being developed.
Initially it is being applied in parallel with the existing mixture of labels and
numbers. When complete, all control labels and anonymous numbers will be replaced by
this.
These will be constant settings in the resepective header files and isolated with
namespaces. They will be directly accessible from any file that includes that
header.

The data available will be:
float min         minumum control value
float max         maximum control value
float def         default control value
bool learn        whether control is MIDI-learnable
bool integer      whether control represents an integer value

The first to get this treatment will be the rotary controls. Next will be the
sliders. Then menus, followed by spin boxes and number rollers.

Finally, check boxes will have just:
bool default
bool learnable
